  * There were 44 five star Vine reviews and 14,626 five star non-Vine reviews
  * About 95 percent of the Vine reviews were five star while only about 65 percent of non-Vine reviews were 5 star
### Summary
There is a very obvious skew in favor of reviews that come from the Vine program. However this could also be becuase there are too few reviews from the Vine program to give a good basis. 95% of reviews being 5 start from that program is just to massive especially when compared to the 65% of non-Vine reviews
Additionally, we could look at review lenth and general use of positive words in relation to Vine and non-Vine reviews.
